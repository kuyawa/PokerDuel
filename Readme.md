Lorem ipsum...

PokerDuel is a simple app to test Kitura and Heroku. Turns out they're very easy to set up and I'll show the details here for everybody to play with it.

This are the steps to have any web page up and running with Kitura on Heroku:

* Get a Heroku account
* Download the CLI (Heroku's Command Line Interface to do some stuff in terminal)
* Go to the dashboard (after login, go to dashboard.heroku.com)
* Create an app, give it a nice name like PokerFight or whatever
* Now open terminal in your PC and let's start the fun
* Clone this repo like:
* $ git clone ...
